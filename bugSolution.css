To avoid unexpected behavior, always ensure that you use consistent units within your `calc()` expressions.  Explicitly define units for all values, mixing percentages and pixels requires careful consideration of the context. For example, instead of `width: calc(100% - 20%);` which is ambiguous, use `width: calc(100% - 20vw);` if you intend 20% of the viewport width. Using explicit units like `px` or `vw` removes ambiguity and ensures consistent behavior across different contexts.
